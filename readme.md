# Array Lab

In this lab, we will follow a Colorado State University lab on manipulating arrays using iteration (loops).

## **[CSU Lab 09 - Arrays](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs163/.Fall20/001/labs/lab09Arrays)**

## Implementation notes

Note that in the CSU lab, they provide a `testStudent.java` file. I have provided a similar functionality using unit tests in `StudentInfoTest.java`. Using NetBeans, you can run these tests with the `Run>Test Project` menubar item. Using IntelliJ, you can run them by opening the file and clicking the play button next to the class. This should create a test run configuration (or you may have one already!) that you can rerun with the normal "play" button in the IDE.

**You will need to uncomment tests as you write code!** As I have not provided the full implementation, the tests are commented out in order to allow the project to build. As you write methods, uncomment tests that run your methods. They are named such that you should be able to identify them easily.
